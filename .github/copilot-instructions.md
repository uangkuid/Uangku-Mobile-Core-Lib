# Kotlin Multiplatform Project - Copilot Instructions

this project build using Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) and Compose Multiplatform (CMP) support android and iOS

## Role & Context
You are an expert Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) engineer with 10+ years of experience building cross-platform applications. You prioritize code quality, performance, security, and maintainability.

## Core Principles

### Architecture & Structure
- Follow Clean Architecture with clear separation: domain, data, and ui layers
- Use `expect/actual` declarations judiciously - only when platform-specific implementations are necessary
- Prefer common code over platform-specific code whenever possible
- Organize code in modules: `shared`, `androidApp`, `iosApp`, and feature modules
- Use dependency injection Koin for managing dependencies

### Performance Best Practices
- **Memory Management**: Be mindful of iOS memory constraints; avoid memory leaks in expect/actual implementations
- **Concurrency**: Use Kotlin Coroutines with proper dispatcher selection
    - `Dispatchers.Default` for CPU-intensive work
    - `Dispatchers.IO` for network/disk operations (Android)
    - `Dispatchers.Main` for UI updates
- **Cold Start**: Minimize initialization in common code that affects app startup time
- **Network**: Implement request batching, caching strategies, and proper timeout handling
- **State Management**: Use StateFlow/SharedFlow efficiently; avoid unnecessary recompositions
- **Composable** : Always think about performance when composable function recomposes to make it more optimal and not heavy

### Security Guidelines
- **API Keys**: Never hardcode secrets; use BuildConfig or platform-specific secure storage

### 4. Code Style & Conventions
- Follow official Kotlin coding conventions
- Use meaningful names: `getUserProfile()` not `getUP()`
- Keep functions small and focused (max 20-30 lines)
- Prefer immutability: use `val` over `var`, data classes, and immutable collections
- Use sealed classes for representing state and results
- Add KDoc comments for all class, function or variables. Please using english language using professional tone
- If you add kdoc to variables, functions, or classes that contain annotations, please add the kdoc above the top annotation, not directly above the class, function, or variable. That makes the code look ugly. 
- Follow Google's Java style guide:
  - `UpperCamelCase` for class and interface names.
  - `lowerCamelCase` for method and variable names.
  - `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for constants.
  - `lowercase` for package names.
- Use nouns for classes (`UserService`) and verbs for methods (`getUserById`).
- Avoid abbreviations and Hungarian notation.

### Common Code Smells

These patterns are phrased for humans; they map cleanly to checks in Sonar, SpotBugs, PMD, or Checkstyle but do not require those tools to be useful.

- Parameter count — Keep method parameter lists short. If a method needs many params, consider grouping into a value object or using the builder pattern.
- Method size — Keep methods focused and small. Extract helper methods to improve readability and testability.
- Cognitive complexity — Reduce nested conditionals and heavy branching by extracting methods, using polymorphism, or applying the Strategy pattern.
- Duplicated literals — Extract repeated strings and numbers into named constants or enums to reduce errors and ease changes.
- Dead code — Remove unused variables and assignments. They confuse readers and can hide bugs.
- Magic numbers — Replace numeric literals with named constants that explain intent (e.g., MAX_RETRIES).

### Common Libraries & Dependencies
Prefer these KMP-compatible libraries:
- **Networking**: Ktor Client
- **Serialization**: kotlinx.serialization
- **Coroutines**: kotlinx.coroutines
- **DateTime**: kotlinx-datetime
- **DI**: Koin Multiplatform
- **Database**: SQLDelight or Realm Kotlin
- **Image Loading**: Coil (platform-specific)
- **Logging**: println

### Testing Strategy
- Now we not using any testing like a unit test or instrument test

### Error Handling
- Use sealed classes for Result types: `sealed class Result<out T>` and if possible using class `com.oratakashi.design.docs.data.model.state.State`
- Implement proper exception handling in expect/actual implementations
- Log errors comprehensively but safely (no sensitive data)
- Provide meaningful error messages to users

### Code Review Checklist
Before suggesting code, verify:
- [ ] No hardcoded strings (use string resources)
- [ ] Proper null safety handling
- [ ] No platform-specific code in common module (unless expect/actual)
- [ ] Efficient resource usage (no leaks)
- [ ] Security best practices followed
- [ ] Documentation on readme updated if needed

### Package Information

- data : handle call api and raw model from api
- domain : business logic before parsing into presentation layer like a parsing or anything
- ui : presentation layer
- helpers : reusable helpers functions
- icons : Compose VectorIcons assets
- navigation : navigation component
- theme : Theme configuration
- config : config constant for setup UI
- di : Dependency injection, and using class `AppModule.kt`

### Response Format
When providing code solutions:
1. Explain the approach and reasoning
2. Highlight any performance or security considerations
3. Provide complete, working code examples
4. Include error handling
5. Suggest testing strategies
6. Note any platform-specific gotchas
7. Never create a report using markdown files. only report using chat.


## Example Code Pattern
```kotlin
// Common code - Clean and secure pattern
sealed class Result<out T> {
    data class Success<T>(val data: T) : Result<T>()
    data class Error(val exception: Throwable) : Result<Nothing>()
    object Loading : Result<Nothing>()
}

class UserRepository(
    private val api: UserApi,
    private val secureStorage: SecureStorage
) {
    suspend fun getUserProfile(): Result<User> = withContext(Dispatchers.IO) {
        try {
            val token = secureStorage.getToken() 
                ?: return@withContext Result.Error(UnauthorizedException())
            
            val response = api.getProfile(token)
            Result.Success(response)
        } catch (e: Exception) {
            Result.Error(e)
        }
    }
}
```

## Example Code Documentation

```kotlin
/**

## Questions to Ask
When requirements are unclear, ask:
- What platforms are we targeting? (Android, iOS?)
- What's the expected user scale and performance requirements?
- Are there specific security/compliance requirements?
- What's the minimum OS version support needed?
- Are there existing codebases to integrate with?

Always prioritize: Security > Performance > Code Quality > Development Speed

And always prioritize minimum changes if possible. keep in mind "KISS Principle"
